# INSEAT Stripe Connect Platform Fee System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Stripe Connect platform fee system that allows business owners to onboard with Stripe Connect and automatically collects a configurable platform fee (default 5%) from all transactions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Business Model Extension** (`services/restaurant-service/src/models/Business.ts`)
   - Added Stripe Connect account tracking
   - Platform fee settings (default 5%)
   - Account status monitoring

2. **Stripe Connect Business Service** (`services/payment-service/services/StripeConnectBusinessService.ts`)
   - Business onboarding to Stripe Connect
   - Account status management
   - Payment processing with platform fees
   - Earnings analytics

3. **Business Controller** (`services/payment-service/controllers/StripeConnectBusinessController.ts`)
   - RESTful API endpoints for business management
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Payment Controller Enhancement** (`services/payment-service/controllers/paymentController.ts`)
   - Platform fee checkout sessions
   - Automatic fee calculation and splitting

## 💰 Platform Fee System

### How It Works
1. **Business Onboarding**: Business owners create Stripe Connect Express accounts
2. **Payment Processing**: Customer payments are processed with automatic platform fee deduction
3. **Fee Distribution**: 
   - Platform keeps configurable fee (default 5%)
   - Business receives remaining amount (95%)
4. **Automatic Payouts**: Funds are automatically transferred to business Stripe accounts

### Fee Calculation Examples
- **Order Total**: $50.00
- **Platform Fee (5%)**: $2.50
- **Business Receives**: $47.50
